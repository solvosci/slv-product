By default, product secondary unit has unlimited precision, but in view are
only shown two decimals. This makes difficult managing factor with a desired
higher precision (like e.g. "0.001").

This addon sets a visual [12,6] precision digit for Product Secondary Unit
factor, that should be enough for the most cases.
