Adds new security group for product management based on Inventory hierarchy.

In this first version, a new "Super Administrator" group is created, and
product creation is reserved for this new group.

This addon ensures that Inventoy, Sales, Purchase and Accouting applications
coundn't create products.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* If new applications are affected, a good approach should be creating 
  independent groups that don't require this initial applications, with a
  new base addon with only Inventory new super group.
